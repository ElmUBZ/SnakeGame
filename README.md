# SnakeGame
This is my version of the classic snake game!

Use your AWSD or arrow keys to manuever the snake and eat as much fruit as you can.

Avoid crashing into yourself or walls, otherwise the game ends.

A .txt file is used to keep track of the top 10 scores!

I developed this code as a passion project to teach myself more about game design, basic command line GUI's, and console outputs. 

Game credits and helpful tutorial credits go to https://paste4btc.com/Lu9Cvpd9.
I used this tutorial to help troubleshoot the development!
