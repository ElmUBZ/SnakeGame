# SnakeGame
This is my version of the classic snake game!

Use your AWSD or arrow keys to manuever the snake and eat as much fruit as you can.

Avoid crashing into yourself or walls, otherwise the game ends.
  "Baby Mode" is an exception, where the snake teleports through walls instead of crashing into them. Select "1 - Easy" to use Baby Mode. 

A .txt file is used to keep track of the top 10 scores!

I developed this code as a passion project to teach myself more about game design, basic command line GUI's, and console outputs.

I used this tutorial to help troubleshoot and guide the development!
